GitHub uses "GitHub Flavored Markdown," or GFM, across the site--in issues,

Render Markdown as HTML
This script was created to convert Markdown files to usable HTML on-the-fly on
various web sites I deal with.  It's intended for situations where the web
server will be serving out Markdown files directly.  It wasn't meant to be
used with blogging or CMS tools. There are usually plug-ins for that.
