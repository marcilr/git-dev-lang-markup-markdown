Markdown


Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax
designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a
tool by the same name.  Markdown is often used to format readme files, for
writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a
plain text editor.

Markdown files can be stored as .txt, but you'll also find:
o .md
o .mdown
o .markdown

Having these clues as a file extension will let you easily transform these
files into others.  Markdown makes it very easy to convert these plaintext
files into HTML, OpenDocument fiels, PDF, LaTeX or RTF using MultiMarkdown.

And, if you haven't noticed yet, StackExchange uses Markdown for formatting,
too!

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.   Markdown allows
you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then
convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
  
Thus, "Markdown" is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a
software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to
HTML.  See the Syntax[1] page for details pertaining to Markdown's formatting
syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the online Dingus.[2]

The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as
readable as possible.  The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should
be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up
with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown's syntax has been
influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source
of inspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email.
      
The best way to get a feel for Markdown's formatting syntax is simply to look
at a Markdown-formatted document.  For example, you can view the Markdown
source for the article text on this page here:
  http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/index.text
    
(You can use this ".text" suffix trick to view the Markdown source for the
content of each of the pages in this section, e.g. the Syntax[1] and License[3]
pages.)

Markdown is free software, available under a BSD-style open source license.
See the License[3] page for more information.

Markdown allows you to add a bit of text markup, like hyperlinks, bold/italics,
or to indicate code with a monospace font.  Markdown is easily converted to
html for viewing in a web browser, and GitHub will do this for you
automatically.
