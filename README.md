# Markdown
"Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax
designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a
tool by the same name.  Markdown is often used to format readme files, for
writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a
plain text editor."
